        <p id="vis-intro">The 2020 United States presidential election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 3, 2020. It will be the 59th
            quadrennial presidential election. However, the is not only one battle for candidates to fight if they want
            to enter the White House at last. For many candidates, The election campaign has already begun one year ago.
            In this page, I will provide some visualization to analyze the data for 2 primary parties and their candidates.
            Trying to figure out the average PCT of each party every month, and who will be the most powerful challenger of Donald Trump.</p>

                    There are many democratic candidates who involved in the 2020 elections, but not all of them have strength
                    to fight against Trump. We choose 3 most powerful democratic candidate, analyze their pct.Â 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    It is a little hard to tell who will face Trump in the final from this visualization. Both Sanders and
                    Biden have chance to beat trump, but their PCTs are all not stable enough. In fact, according to the chart,
                    every candidates list here could be the winner, since they all have advantage among others in a specific time period.
                </p>

                    This Box Plot chart shows the min/max whiskers, that reflected the distribution of the PCT of every candidates.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    When you hover on the box, it will display the data for the candidate. There are totally 8 democratic candidates
                    who have a higher median value of PCT, compared to Donald Trump. They are: Bernard Sanders, Elizabeth Warren,
                    Joseph R. Biden JR., Michael Bloomberg, Michelle Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Oprah Winfrey, and Sherrod Brown.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    However, some of them have only a few data, which is not persuasive enough to prove they could win Trump.

                    This bar chart displays the average PCT of two parties(all candidates), as well the average PCT from Nov
                    2018 to now. You can also let it displays the average value of the months you select with a interval selector.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    For now, the difference of 2 parties is very small. For the recent 3 month, the value is nearly same.
                    Therefore, it is hard to tell which side will win at last.
